Exercise
CSV to DataFrame (1)
Putting data in a dictionary and then building a DataFrame works, but it's not very efficient. What if you're dealing with millions of observations? In those cases, the data is typically available as files with a regular structure. One of those file types is the CSV file, which is short for "comma-separated values".

To import CSV data into Python as a Pandas DataFrame you can use read_csv().

Let's explore this function with the same cars data from the previous exercises. This time, however, the data is available in a CSV file, named cars.csv. It is available in your current working directory, so the path to the file is simply 'cars.csv'.

To import CSV files you still need the pandas package: import it as pd.
Use pd.read_csv() to import cars.csv data as a DataFrame. Store this DataFrame as cars.
Print out cars. Does everything look OK?

# Import pandas as pd
import pandas as pd

# Import the cars.csv data: cars
cars = pd.read_csv('cars.csv')

# Print out cars
print(cars)
